Create a fully functional B2B platform that connects businesses needing tech solutions with software service providers. The platform should have:

1️⃣ User Roles & Authentication
	•	Two user roles: Buyers (companies posting projects) & Sellers (service providers submitting proposals).
	•	Secure sign-up & login system with email authentication.
	•	Role-based access control (buyers can’t apply for projects, sellers can’t post projects).

2️⃣ Dashboard Design

Buyer Dashboard (For companies posting projects)
	•	Post a Project: A form with fields: Title, Description, Budget, Deadline.
	•	View Offers: A list of proposals submitted by sellers.
	•	Project Progress: Status updates and reports on ongoing projects.

Seller Dashboard (For service providers)
	•	Browse Projects: A list of available projects posted by buyers.
	•	Submit Proposal: A form with fields: Service Details, Price, Estimated Delivery Time.
	•	Ongoing Projects: A task management section to track progress on accepted projects.

3️⃣ Database Schema
	•	Users: Stores user details (name, email, password, role).
	•	Projects: Stores project details (title, description, budget, deadline, status, buyer_id).
	•	Proposals: Stores offers from sellers (service_details, price, delivery_time, project_id, seller_id).
	•	Payments: Tracks payments (project_id, amount, commission, status).

4️⃣ Payments (Stripe Integration)
	•	Implement Stripe for secure transactions.
	•	Buyers pay through the platform, which deducts a 15% commission before transferring funds to sellers.
	•	Payment tracking system for transparency.

5️⃣ Communication System
	•	In-app messaging for discussions between buyers and sellers.
	•	Email notifications when a project is posted, an offer is received, or a payment is processed.

6️⃣ Security & Privacy
	•	Restrict direct contact to ensure all transactions happen on the platform.
	•	Enable SSL encryption and role-based permissions.

7️⃣ UI/UX Design
	•	Modern, minimalistic design with blue & white color themes.
	•	Responsive layout for desktop and mobile use.

8️⃣ Deployment & Scalability
	•	Deploy on Replit with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or Firebase).
	•	Ensure API endpoints are secured for future mobile app expansion.

Build this as a scalable, ready-to-launch B2B marketplace with a seamless user experience.”
